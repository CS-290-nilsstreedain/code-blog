			<h2>Assignment 4 - 11/14/2022</h2>
			<p><b>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</b></p>
			<p>I would say the most callenging part was efficiently reading the files into memory. Though initially not difficult, I wanted to read for the directory file list into a map to prevent rework code. This was my first time using fs for node.js</p>
			<p><b>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</b></p>
			<p>I'm not sure if there was anything big picture I learned from the assignment but there were smaller, in the weeds, coding things I learned such as how to create a basic HashMap in JavaScript/Node.js.</p>
			<p><b>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</b></p>
			<p>I mostly used my previous code portfolio as reference with the exception of looking up HashMaps and readdir().</p>
			<p><b>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</b></p>
			<p>As stated above, HashMaps & readdir().</p>
			<h2>Assignment 3 - 10/03/2022</h2>
			<p><b>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</b></p>
			<p>The most challenging thing for me was probably getting my head around parsing data from the HTML, I have limited experience with JavaScript but I'v$
			<p><b>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</b></p>
			<p>I'm not sure if there was much in particular I learned yet but I definetely felt myself getting more comfortable with JS and felt I was able to wri$

			<p>My most helpful resource has been refering back to old code I've written. I often dig deep in finding the way I like to write a type of line or fun$
			<p><b>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</b></p>
			<p>As someone less familiar with JS compaired to other languages I ended up having to lookup the isNaN() function after using ParseInt.</p>
			<h2>Assignment 2 - 10/18/2022</h2>
			<p><b>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</b></p>
			<p>I have pretty good experience with HTML/CSS so the most frustrating thing was just constantly compairing back and fourth while not knowing specific measurements like padding/margin and trying to get it close.</p>
			<p><b>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</b></p>
			<p>There wasn't much I learned as I've feel pretty comfortable with HTML/CSS already.</p>
			<p><b>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</b></p>
			<p>The only external tools I used was the macOS HEX color picker, the rest was pretty self-explanatory.</p>
			<p><b>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</b></p>
			<p>I didn't have to Google anything, I was able to reference everthing I needed from previous CSS I've written.</p>
			<h2>Assignment 1 - 09/29/2022</h3>
			<p><b>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</b></p>
			<p>I have pretty good experience with HTML/CSS so I wouldn't say I had many challenges.</p>
			<p><b>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</b></p>
			<p>Again, I have a lot of experience with HTML/CSS so I don't think there was much for me to learn yet.</p>
			<p><b>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</b></p>
			<p>I didn't use any outside resources for this assignment.</p>
